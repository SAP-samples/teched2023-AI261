## Step 3: Check and observe various elements(nodes, edges, execution) the model as next step.

## Step 6: On the left uncertainty influencers, you see all nodes that are of type ‘single’ or ‘range value’ types from the model. 

The user may modify the data range by dragging the sidebar to the desired value.

## Step 7: The user can set the estimate min and max value of all range value influencers.

## Step 8: By clicking the distribution curve (1), the user opens a section with a drop-down menu and via the drop-down menu the user can select a normal or a uniform distribution curve

## Step 9: The user can tweak the threshold on the fly by sliding the bar. User can use the sliders in the graph to adjust the threshold values to suit to business needs. 
*Note: To get a scenario probability chart as shown in the picture below, at least one influencer should have a range value (i.e., low and high value set).

## Step 10: The user can view more details about the grouped scenarios by clicking the “Details” field which then shows all contributing influencer values through which output variable and probabilities have been computed.
